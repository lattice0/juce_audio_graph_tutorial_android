## Juce Graph Audio Processor Android

A port of https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_audio_processor_graph.html to Android, possibly compilable with iOS too. 

To make it work, run and then go in the settings and give a manual microphone permission, it will not ask to, it's a bare minimum example just for learning.

Also make sure nothing else is using the microphone on your device.
